# spir-250 — t3code is the front end

## 2026-08-30 — plan phase

Spec 250 arrived approved (frontmatter `approved: 2026-08-30`, validated by claude + codex), so
porch handed me the plan phase directly.

### What I verified before planning, rather than taking the spec's word for it

- `/Users/chris/dev/t3code` is at `082e6ea52`, clean, remote `pingdotgg/t3code`. Matches
  `pin.json`'s `commit`.
- `/Users/chris/dev/t3code-codev` **does not exist yet**. The fork is phase 1's work, not a
  precondition someone already met.
- `OrchestrationThreadShell` (`packages/contracts/src/orchestration.ts:469` in the clone) has no
  parent field and no metadata bag, as the spec says. `ThreadCreatedPayload` at `:1148` carries
  only threadId/projectId/title/model/runtime/interaction/branch/worktreePath/timestamps.
- Upstream's live migration range ends at **42** (`042_ProjectionThreadLinkedPullRequest`). That
  is why the plan numbers ours at 900/901 — the spec said "far above" without naming a number.
- Upstream scopes are `orchestration:read`, `orchestration:operate`, `terminal:operate`,
  `review:write`, `access:read/write`, `relay:*`. Nothing expresses gate-writing, confirming the
  spec's `codev:gate-write` addition is necessary rather than convenient.
- `codev-agent`'s route prefix is `/api/agent/v1`, and the route table already carries
  `gate-approve`, `approval-submit`, `session-probe`, `pairing-redeem`, `human-session-issue`.
  Phase 10 proxies to these; it does not invent a new approval surface.
- t3code is `pnpm@11.10.0`, `engines.node: ^24.13.1`.

### Decisions I made that the spec left to the plan

1. **Migration numbers 900 and 901.** Spec said "number ours far above upstream's range"; 900
   with upstream at 42 gives an 858-migration gap, and a test asserts upstream has not reached it.
2. **`T3CODE_FORK_ROOT` as a second variable.** The spec ruled the identities explicit but named
   no variable. Stretching `T3CODE_ROOT` over both is exactly the failure it warns about.
3. **`tools/t3-fork/patches/` as a review aid.** The fork's commits cannot appear in this repo's
   PR, so a reviewer would otherwise have no diff for the six changes. Stated in the plan as a
   review aid only — approach 1 (patch set applied to a checkout) stays rejected.
4. **Eleven phases.** The vendoring harness is built first, while fork HEAD still equals
   `upstreamBase`, so its assertions have known answers before any customization exists to hide a
   harness bug inside.

### Flagged for the architect

Phase 1 runs `gh repo fork pingdotgg/t3code` — creating a **public** fork under `pseudoseed`.
Outward-facing and not quietly undoable. The spec bakes the destination, so it is decided, but
the act itself is worth a look before it happens.
