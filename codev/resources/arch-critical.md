# arch-critical.md — Always-On System-Shape Facts (HOT tier)

<!-- HOT tier: capped facts + a bounded map of arch.md. Always injected into every porch
phase prompt and into CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md. CAP: <=10 facts, <=12 map topics, <=35 lines.
To add a fact, DEMOTE a weaker one into arch.md (displacement). MAINTAIN polices the cap
and keeps the map in sync with arch.md's top-level sections. See codev/resources/arch.md. -->

## Critical facts (consult before deciding)
- Framework files resolve at RUNTIME via the four-tier chain (.codev/ → codev/ → cache → skeleton); they are NOT copied into projects. Don't wire features to "scaffold copies it."
- t3code is the FRONT END (Spec 250), via a private fork (`pseudoseed/t3code@codev`, `pin.commit`); `/Users/chris/dev/t3code` is the read-only upstream clone pinned to `pin.upstreamBase` — never check it out, never `gh repo fork`. `apps/client` is the FROZEN fallback: keep it green, build new front-end work in the fork. Every fork commit obliges `tools/t3-codegen/REFRESH.md`.
- Two trees: codev/ = our instance, codev-skeleton/ = the template shipped to adopters. Mirror every framework change in BOTH.
- CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md MUST stay byte-identical (same content, two tool ecosystems).
- Porch is a pure planner: it emits task JSON, Claude Code executes. Never hand-edit status.yaml.
- State lives in a single user-global ~/.agent-farm/global.db (Issue #1118 retired the per-workspace state.db; architect/builders keyed by workspace_path); one Tower on port 4100. Never modify state by hand.
- Worktrees in .builders/ are Agent-Farm-managed — never delete manually (use afx cleanup); run afx from the main workspace root only.
- Server/client isolation (#1189): codev-core (server) and codev-sdk (client) never import each other; both import only codev-types. The sdk is environment-agnostic (no node:*/vscode/direct fetch outside its /node adapter; zero runtime deps) — boundary tests on both sides enforce this in CI.
- `afx send` is mailbox-first (Spec 1313): persist to global.db first, then deliver only onto a render-gate-verified empty prompt. Any new message writer routes through the mailbox+gate — never write a PTY directly, never force-inject. Response: `delivered` | `held`+reason.
- Two human gates (spec-approval, plan-approval) plus the pr gate; only humans transition conceived→specified and committed→integrated.

## Map of arch.md (consult when…)
- Invariants & Constraints — touching state, ports, worktrees, or anything "MUST remain true."
- Installation Architecture — touching init/adopt/update or the four-tier resolver.
- Agent Farm Internals — changing spawn, Tower, terminals, or inter-agent messaging.
- Repository Dual Nature — before editing any framework file (codev/ vs skeleton).
- Core Components — locating where logic lives or wiring a new module.
- Key Design Decisions — before reversing a design choice (the "why").
- System-Wide Patterns — adding cross-cutting behavior.
- Integration Points — crossing a subsystem or process boundary.
- Monorepo Structure — adding a package or build wiring.
- Technology Stack — choosing or upgrading a dependency.
- VS Code Extension — touching the retained unsupported source or its retirement boundary.
- Glossary — when a term is unfamiliar.
