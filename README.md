![Agent Farm Dashboard](docs/assets/agent-farm-hero.png)

> **New: [A Tour of CodevOS](https://waleedk.medium.com/a-tour-of-codevos-1db0fe0e4516)** — A deep dive into how Codev orchestrates human-agent collaboration: the SPIR protocol, Agent Farm, multi-model consultation, and the architecture that ties it all together.

Codev turns GitHub Issues into tested, reviewed PRs. You write specs; autonomous AI builders handle the rest.

> **Results**: One architect + autonomous AI builders shipped [106 PRs in 14 days](codev/resources/development-analysis-2026-02-17.md), median feature in 57 minutes. In controlled comparison, SPIR consistently outperformed unstructured AI coding across [4 rounds](codev/resources/vibe-vs-spir-r4-comparison-2026-02.md). [Case study](#-example-implementations) | [Production data](#production-metrics-feb-2026)

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install -g @cluesmith/codev

# 2. Initialize a project
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
codev init

# 3. Verify setup
codev doctor

# 4. Start the workspace (optional)
afx workspace start
```

Then open a GitHub Issue describing what you want to build, and run:

```bash
afx spawn <issue-number>
```

For the full walkthrough, see **[Getting Started](https://codevos.ai/getting-started)**.

**CLI Commands:**
- `codev` - Main CLI (init, adopt, doctor, update)
- `afx` - Agent Farm for parallel AI builders
- `consult` - Multi-model consultation

See [CLI Reference](codev/resources/commands/overview.md) for details.

## How It Works

1. **Write a spec** — Describe what you want. The architect helps refine it.
2. **Spawn a builder** — `afx spawn 42` kicks off an autonomous agent in an isolated worktree.
3. **Review the plan** — The builder writes an implementation plan. You approve or annotate.
4. **Walk away** — The builder implements, tests, and opens a PR. You review and merge.

### Prerequisites

**Core (required):**

| Dependency | Install | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Node.js 18+ | `brew install node` | Runtime |

### 🎯 Codev Tour - Building a Conversational Todo Manager
See Codev in action! Follow along as we use the SPIR protocol to build a conversational todo list manager from scratch:

👉 [**Codev Demo Tour**](https://github.com/ansari-project/codev-demo/blob/main/codev-tour.md)

This tour demonstrates:
- How to write specifications that capture all requirements
- How the planning phase breaks work into manageable chunks
- The implementation phase in action
- Multi-agent consultation with GPT-5 and Gemini (via agy)
- How lessons learned improve future development

## What is Codev?

Codev is a development methodology that treats **natural language context as code**. Instead of writing code first and documenting later, you start with clear specifications that both humans and AI agents can understand and execute.

📖 **Read the full story**: [Why We Created Codev: From Theory to Practice](docs/why.md) - Learn about our journey from theory to implementation and how we built a todo app without directly editing code.

### Core Philosophy

1. **Context Drives Code** - Context definitions flow from high-level specifications down to implementation details
2. **Human-AI Collaboration** - Designed for seamless cooperation between developers and AI agents
3. **Evolving Methodology** - The process itself evolves and improves with each project

## The SPIR Protocol

Our flagship protocol for structured development:

- **S**pecify - Define what to build in clear, unambiguous language
- **P**lan - Break specifications into executable phases
- **I**mplement - Build the code, write tests, verify requirements for each phase
- **R**eview - Capture lessons and improve the methodology

## Project Structure

After running `codev init` or `codev adopt`, your project has a **minimal structure**:

```
your-project/
├── codev/
│   ├── specs/              # Feature specifications
│   ├── plans/              # Implementation plans
│   ├── reviews/            # Review and lessons learned
│   └── resources/           # Reference materials
├── AGENTS.md               # AI agent instructions (AGENTS.md standard)
├── CLAUDE.md               # AI agent instructions (Claude Code)
└── [your code]
```

### Customizable and Extendable

Codev is designed to be customized for your project's needs. The `codev/` directory is yours to extend:

- **Add project-specific protocols** - For example, Codev itself has a `release` protocol specific to npm publishing
- **Customize existing protocols** - Modify SPIR phases to match your team's workflow
- **Add new roles** - Define specialized consultant or reviewer roles

The framework provides defaults, but your local files always take precedence.

### Context Hierarchy

In much the same way an operating system has a memory hierarchy, Codev repos have a context hierarchy. The codev/ directory holds the top 3 layers. This allows both humans and agents to think about problems at different levels of detail.

![Context Hierarchy](codev/resources/context-hierarchy.png)

**Key insight**: We build from the top down, and we propagate information from the bottom up. We start with a GitHub issue, then spec and plan out the feature, generate the code, and then propagate what we learned through the reviews.

## Key Features

### 📄 Natural Language is the Primary Programming Language
- Specifications and plans drive implementation
- All decisions captured in version control
- Clear traceability from idea to implementation

### 🤖 AI-Native Workflow
- Structured formats that AI agents understand
- Multi-agent consultation support (GPT-5, Gemini via agy, etc.)
- Reduces back-and-forth from dozens of messages to 3-4 document reviews
- Supports both AGENTS.md standard (Cursor, Copilot, etc.) and CLAUDE.md (Claude Code)

### 🔄 Continuous Improvement
- Every project improves the methodology
- Lessons learned feed back into the process
- Templates evolve based on real experience

## 📚 Example Implementations

Both projects below were given **the exact same prompt** to build a Todo Manager application using **Claude Code with Opus**. The difference? The methodology used:

### [Todo Manager - VIBE](https://github.com/ansari-project/todo-manager-vibe)
- Built using a **VIBE-style prompt** approach (same model, same prompt)
- Produced boilerplate scaffolding but 0% of the specified functionality
- No tests, no database, no working API — demonstrates how conversational approaches can miss the mark entirely

### [Todo Manager - SPIR](https://github.com/ansari-project/codev-demo)
- Built using the **SPIR protocol** with full document-driven development
- Same requirements, but structured through formal specifications and plans
- Demonstrates all phases: Specify → Plan → Implement → Review
- Complete with specs, plans, and review documents
- Multi-agent consultation throughout the process

<details>
<summary><strong>📊 Multi-Agent Comparison (4 rounds)</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

**Methodology**: Same prompt, same AI model (Claude Opus). Unstructured (conversational) vs SPIR (structured protocol). Scored by 3 independent AI agents (Claude, Codex, Gemini Pro) on a 1-10 scale. Full auto-approved gates — no human review input — to isolate the protocol's effect.

#### Latest Results (Round 4, Feb 2026)

| Dimension | Unstructured | SPIR | Delta |
|-----------|:----------:|:----:|:-----:|
| **Overall** | **5.8** | **7.0** | **+1.2** |
| Bugs | 6.7 | 7.3 | +0.7 |
| Code Quality | 7.0 | 7.7 | +0.7 |
| Tests | 5.0 | 6.7 | +1.7 |
| Deployment | 2.7 | 6.7 | +4.0 |

#### Key Findings

- **+1.2 quality advantage consistent across all 4 rounds** (R1: +1.3, R2: +1.2, R4: +1.2)
- SPIR produced **2.9x more test code** with broader layer coverage
- SPIR produced **fewer source lines** (1,249 vs 1,294) while being more complete — the first round where structured code was more concise
- **Deployment readiness** showed the largest delta of any dimension in any round (+4.0): multi-stage Dockerfile, standalone output, deploy instructions
- Multi-agent consultation caught **5 implementation bugs pre-merge** at a cost of $4.38

**Build time**: SPIR took ~56 min vs ~15 min for unstructured (3.7x). Consultation accounts for 45% of the overhead. Estimated cost: $14-19 vs $4-7 (3-5x). For production code, the deployment readiness and test coverage alone justify the investment.

## 🐕 Eating Our Own Dog Food

Codev is **self-hosted** — we use Codev to build Codev. Every feature goes through SPIR. Every improvement has a spec, plan, and review.

### Production Metrics (Feb 2026)

Over a 14-day sprint building Codev with Codev ([full analysis](codev/resources/development-analysis-2026-02-17.md)):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Merged PRs | 106 |
| Closed issues | 105 |
| Commits | 801 |
| Median feature implementation | 57 minutes |
| Fully autonomous builders | 85% (22 of 26) |
| Pre-merge bugs caught by consultation | 20 |
| Consultation cost per PR | $1.59 |

One architect with autonomous builders matched the output of a **3-4 person elite engineering team** (benchmarked against 5 PRs/developer/week from LinearB's 2026 analysis of 8.1M PRs). The bugfix pipeline is genuinely autonomous: 66% of fixes ship in under 30 minutes (median 13 min from PR creation to merge).

Multi-agent consultation catches real bugs that single-model review misses. No single reviewer found all 20 bugs — Codex excels at edge-case exhaustiveness, Claude at runtime semantics, Gemini at architecture.

This self-hosting approach ensures:
1. The methodology is battle-tested on real development
2. We experience the same workflow we recommend to users
3. Pain points are felt by us first and fixed quickly
4. The framework evolves based on actual usage, not theory

### Understanding This Repository's Structure

This repository has a dual nature:

1. **`codev/`** - Our instance of Codev for developing Codev itself
   - Contains our specs, plans, reviews, and resources
   - Example: `codev/specs/0001-test-infrastructure.md` documents how we built our test suite

2. **`codev-skeleton/`** - The template that gets installed in other projects
   - Contains protocol definitions, templates, and agents
   - What users get when they install Codev
   - Does NOT contain specs/plans/reviews (those are created by users)

**In short**: `codev/` is how we use Codev, `codev-skeleton/` is what we provide to others.

<details>
<summary><strong>Test Infrastructure</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

Our test suite validates the Codev CLI and Agent Farm:

- **Framework**: Vitest (unit tests) + Playwright (E2E tests)
- **Coverage**: CLI commands, porch protocol orchestration, Agent Farm dashboard
- **Isolation**: Tests run in isolated environments

```bash
# From packages/codev/
npm test              # Run unit tests
npm run test:e2e      # Run E2E tests
```

See [Testing Guide](codev/resources/testing-guide.md) for details.

## Examples

### Todo Manager Tutorial

See `examples/todo-manager/` for a complete walkthrough showing:
- How specifications capture all requirements
- How plans break work into phases
- How the implementation phase ensures quality
- How lessons improve future development

## Configuration

### Customizing Templates

Templates in `codev/protocols/spir/templates/` can be modified to fit your team's needs:

- `spec.md` - Specification structure
- `plan.md` - Planning format
- `lessons.md` - Retrospective template

## Agent Farm (Optional)

Agent Farm is an optional companion tool for Codev that provides a web-based dashboard for managing multiple AI agents working in parallel. **You can use Codev without Agent Farm** - all protocols (SPIR, TICK, etc.) work perfectly in any AI coding assistant.

**Why use Agent Farm?**
- **Web dashboard** for monitoring multiple builders at once
- **Protocol-aware** - knows about specs, plans, and Codev conventions
- **Git worktree management** - isolates each builder's changes
- **Automatic prompting** - builders start with instructions to implement their assigned spec

**Current limitations:**
- Uses **shellper processes** for persistent terminal sessions (node-pty handles terminal I/O)
- macOS-focused (should work on Linux but less tested)

### Alternative Agent Shells

Agent Farm supports multiple AI coding agents as shells. Configure in `.codev/config.json`:

**Claude Code** (default):
```json
{
  "shell": {
    "architect": "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions",
    "builder": "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions"
  }
}
```

**OpenCode** (builder only):
```json
{
  "shell": {
    "architect": "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions",
    "builder": "opencode"
  }
}
```

OpenCode supports 75+ LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama, etc.). When using OpenCode as a builder:
- Use plain `opencode`, not `opencode run`. The harness seeds the builder's initial task via `--prompt`, which starts the TUI with the message already in flight and leaves it running. `opencode run` answers once and exits, so the builder would stop after a single turn.
- Configure tool permissions for unattended execution in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` or your project's `opencode.json`:
  ```json
  { "permission": { "edit": "allow", "bash": "allow" } }
  ```
- OpenCode reads `AGENTS.md` for project instructions (already present in Codev projects)
- OpenCode is only supported as a **builder** shell, not as an architect shell

Codex is also supported via the harness system. See `packages/codev/src/agent-farm/utils/harness.ts` for details, or define a custom harness in `.codev/config.json`. (The built-in **Gemini CLI** harness is **retired** — see the note under Autonomous Builder Flags below.)

## Architect-Builder Pattern

For parallel AI-assisted development, Codev includes the Architect-Builder pattern:

- **Architect** (you + primary AI): Creates specs and plans, reviews work
- **Builders** (autonomous AI agents): Implement specs in isolated git worktrees

### Quick Start

```bash
# Start the workspace
afx workspace start

# Spawn a builder for a spec
afx spawn 3 --protocol spir

# Check status
afx status

# Stop everything
afx workspace stop
```

The `afx` command is globally available after installing `@cluesmith/codev`.

### Remote Access

Access Agent Farm from any device via cloud connectivity:

```bash
afx tower connect
```

Register your tower with [codevos.ai](https://codevos.ai) for secure remote access from any browser — no SSH tunnels or port forwarding needed.

### Autonomous Builder Flags

Builders need permission-skipping flags to run autonomously without human approval prompts:

| CLI Tool | Flag | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Claude Code | `--dangerously-skip-permissions` | Skip permission prompts for file/command operations |

Configure in `.codev/config.json` (created by `codev init` or `codev adopt`):
```json
{
  "shell": {
    "architect": "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions",
    "builder": "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions"
  }
}
```

The built-in **Gemini CLI** harness is **retired** as a builder/architect shell: Google ended
consumer Gemini CLI access (Pro, Ultra, and free tiers) on 2026-06-18, so it is no longer offered as
a supported built-in shell. Switch to a supported harness — `claude` or `codex` for either role, or
`opencode` for builders (OpenCode is not supported as an architect shell). For example, Codex for
both roles:
```json
{
  "shell": {
    "architect": "codex",
    "builder": "codex"
  }
}
```
If you retain Gemini CLI access (a Standard/Enterprise subscription or API-key auth), you can still
run it by defining a **custom harness** named `gemini` in `.codev/config.json` **and selecting it
explicitly** with `shell.builderHarness` / `shell.architectHarness`. The explicit selector is
**required**: a bare auto-detected `gemini` command (e.g. `shell.builder: "gemini --yolo"` with no
`builderHarness`) stays retired, because auto-detection resolves the built-in namespace only.
```json
{
  "shell": {
    "builder": "gemini --yolo",
    "builderHarness": "gemini"
  },
  "harness": {
    "gemini": {
      "roleArgs": [],
      "roleEnv": { "GEMINI_SYSTEM_MD": "${ROLE_FILE}" },
      "roleScriptFragment": "",
      "roleScriptEnv": { "GEMINI_SYSTEM_MD": "${ROLE_FILE}" }
    }
  }
}
```
The Gemini CLI reads its system prompt from the `GEMINI_SYSTEM_MD` environment variable pointing at
the role file, so the custom harness injects via `roleEnv` / `roleScriptEnv` (with empty `roleArgs`) —
reproducing exactly what the retired built-in harness did.
See `packages/codev/src/agent-farm/utils/harness.ts` for the custom-harness fields. This is separate
from the `gemini` **consult lane**, which is unaffected and now uses the Antigravity CLI `agy`.

**Warning**: These flags allow the AI to execute commands and modify files without asking. Only use in development environments where you trust the AI's actions.

See [CLI Reference](codev/resources/commands/agent-farm.md) for full documentation.

## Releases

Codev has a **release protocol** (`codev/protocols/release/`) that automates the entire release process. To release a new version:

```
Let's release v2.2.0
```

The AI guides you through: pre-flight checks, maintenance cycle, E2E tests, version bump, release notes, GitHub release, and npm publish.

### Versioning Strategy

| Version Type | npm Tag | Example | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Stable | `latest` | 2.1.1, 2.2.0 | Production-ready releases |
| Release Candidate | `next` | 2.2.0-rc.1 | Pre-release testing |
| Patch | `latest` | 2.1.2 | Backported bug fixes |

Minor releases use release candidates (`npm install @cluesmith/codev@next`) for testing before stable release.

Releases are named after great examples of architecture from around the world. See [Release Notes](docs/releases/) for version history.
