/**
 * #1494: the Approve button relays the human's decision to the builder's
 * spawning architect, instead of the extension shelling out to `porch approve`
 * itself. This mirrors how humans already work with codev — they tell the
 * architect a gate was approved, and the architect passes it on to the builder,
 * who runs the command — and keeps the architect in the loop so its model of the
 * builder doesn't go stale between gates.
 *
 * `decideApprovalRelay` is the pure routing core: given the builder's owning
 * architect and the workspace's *live* architects, it decides where (or whether)
 * the decision goes. It is deliberately free of `vscode`/Tower so the four
 * branches are unit-testable without a running Tower.
 *
 * The `owner` input is `OverviewBuilder.spawnedByArchitect`. `liveArchitectNames`
 * is `OverviewData.architects.map(a => a.name)` — which reports LIVENESS, not
 * registration (Tower skips architects with no live session), so an empty list
 * means "no architect is live right now", NOT "this is a CLI-only workspace".
 * That distinction is why the last branch is named `no-live-architect` and
 * announces only what liveness can support.
 *
 * We must NOT fold a null owner into `main` the way `builder-grouping.ts` does
 * for display (#1406): a misrouted status line is noise, but a misrouted
 * *approval* sends a human's gate decision to an architect that did not spawn
 * the builder.

/**

 * imperative framing matters: a past-tense fact reads as "already done", so the
 * architect never relays it and the builder stalls.
 *
 * **Spec 146 Phase 6 changed who runs the command.** This used to say "please
 * pass it to the builder", routing execution to the builder — and `porch approve`
 * now refuses any call whose cwd is inside a `.builders/` worktree, so following
 * that cue ended in `APPROVAL_CAPABILITY_REQUIRED` and exit 1. The architect runs
 * it, from the workspace root. The message names `porch approve` and where to run
 * it — but not the full argument list, which the architect already knows — because
 * the builder prompt that used to cover the command now tells the builder not to
 * run it at all.
 *
 * Provenance (a human clicked in VS Code) is carried by the `[USER via VS Code]`
 * header Tower renders from the `VSCODE_USER_SENDER` `from`, not by text in the
 * body.
 *
 * `id` is the builder handle the architect routes to; `issueId` is appended only
 * when the id doesn't already carry it, so a builder whose id is the issue number
 * (e.g. `158`, issue `#158`) doesn't render the number twice.
