/**
 * #1494 — the Approve button relays the human's decision to the builder's
 * spawning architect instead of shelling out to `porch approve` itself.
 *
 * These tests pin the pure core of that change:
 *  - `decideApprovalRelay` — the four routing branches, provable without a Tower.
 *  - `buildRelayMessage`: an imperative relay instruction; no porch, no command, no double-rendered id.
 *  - `interpretRelayResult`— relayed / held / failed, never "approved" (the `held` case is first-class).
 *
 * `approve.ts` imports `vscode` at module load, so we mock it even though the
 * functions under test never touch it (established `__tests__` pattern).
