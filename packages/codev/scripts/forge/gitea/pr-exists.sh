# Forge concept: pr-exists (Gitea via tea CLI)
# Input: CODEV_BRANCH_NAME
# Output: "true" or "false"
#
# Returns true for OPEN or MERGED pulls only; closed-not-merged pulls are
# excluded. `tea pulls list` emits `.head` as a string (not `{ref}`) and reports
# merged PRs as state "merged" with no `.merged` boolean, so its output can't
# satisfy the `.head.ref` / `.merged` predicate below. Route through the raw
# REST passthrough, whose PR objects carry nested `.head.ref` and a `.merged`
# bool. `tea api` needs an explicit owner/repo in the path (unlike `tea pulls`,
# which auto-detects it from the local git remote), so resolve it here: honor
# CODEV_REPO when set, else derive owner/repo from origin's URL (handles https,
# ssh, and scp-style remotes, with or without a .git suffix).
#
# Caveat (Gitea behavior, not a codev bug): for a merged PR whose source branch
# was deleted, Gitea returns `.head.ref == "refs/pull/N/head"` instead of the
# original branch name, so a branch-name match won't hit a merged+deleted
# branch. That doesn't affect the "does an open/merged PR exist for the branch
# I'm about to push" use case.
#
# `state=all` is paginated (Gitea caps a page at max_response_items, default 50)
# so a branch whose PR isn't in the most recent ~50 would false-negative and
# block a porch pr_exists gate — tea_api_paged walks every page (see _lib.sh).
