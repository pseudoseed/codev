# Forge concept: recently-merged (Gitea via tea CLI)
# Output: JSON [{number, title, url, body, createdAt, mergedAt, headRefName}]
#         (MergedPrItem in forge-contracts.ts)
#
# `tea pulls list --fields …,head,description,merged` errors on the `description`
# field and emits `.head` as a string, so it can't populate `body` or
# `.head.ref`. Route through the raw REST passthrough instead, whose closed
# pulls carry `.merged`, `.merged_at`, nested `.head.ref`, and `.body`. Keep
# only merged pulls (closed-without-merge have `.merged == false`). `tea api`
# needs an explicit owner/repo in the path (unlike `tea pulls`, which
# auto-detects it from the local git remote), so resolve it here: honor
# CODEV_REPO when set, else derive owner/repo from origin's URL (handles https,
# ssh, and scp-style remotes, with or without a .git suffix).
#
# The closed-pulls list is paginated (Gitea caps a page at max_response_items,
# default 50), so on a busy repo the most-recent merges could push older ones
# past the first page — tea_api_paged walks every page (see _lib.sh).
