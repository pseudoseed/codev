# Forge concept: issue-view (Gitea via tea CLI)
# forge-executable: tea
# Input: CODEV_ISSUE_ID
# Output: JSON {title, body, state, url, comments[]}  (IssueViewResult)
#
# `tea issues view N --output json` returns a flattened single-element list
# (no body/html_url/url), so route through the raw REST passthrough. `tea api`
# needs an explicit owner/repo in the path (unlike `tea issues`, which
# auto-detects it from the local git remote), so resolve it here: honor
# CODEV_REPO when set, else derive owner/repo from origin's URL (handles
# https, ssh, and scp-style remotes, with or without a .git suffix).
#
# `url` is mapped to the issue's browser page (`html_url`); Gitea's own `url`
# is the API endpoint (would render raw JSON in a browser), so we fall back to
# it only if `html_url` is absent.
#
# Gitea's issue object reports `comments` as an integer count, not the array
# the contract requires (consumers call `.comments.filter(...)`), so the
# comments array is fetched separately and merged in. A failed/empty comments
# fetch degrades to [], but warns on stderr so the degraded path is
# distinguishable from a genuinely uncommented issue (stdout stays pure JSON —
# it's parsed by forge.ts).
