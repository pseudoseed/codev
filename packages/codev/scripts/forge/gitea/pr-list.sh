# Forge concept: pr-list (Gitea via tea CLI) — open pulls
# forge-executable: tea
# Output: JSON [{number, title, url, reviewDecision, body, createdAt, author,
#                reviewRequests, isDraft}]  (PrListItem in forge-contracts.ts)
#
# `tea pulls list --fields …,description` errors ("invalid field 'description'")
# and its flattened output can't carry a PR body, draft flag, or requested
# reviewers. Route through the raw REST passthrough instead, whose PR objects
# expose all of them. `tea api` needs an explicit owner/repo in the path (unlike
# `tea pulls`, which auto-detects it from the local git remote), so resolve it
# here: honor CODEV_REPO when set, else derive owner/repo from origin's URL
# (handles https, ssh, and scp-style remotes, with or without a .git suffix).
#
# Field mapping:
#   .number                       -> number (already an int in the REST shape)
#   .html_url                     -> url (browser page; Gitea `.url` is the API endpoint)
#   .body                         -> body
#   .created_at                   -> createdAt
#   .user.login                   -> author.login
#   .requested_reviewers[].login  -> reviewRequests (user logins; teams have no login → dropped)
#   .draft                        -> isDraft
#   reviewDecision                -> ""  (Gitea has no GitHub-equivalent review-decision summary)
#
# The open-pulls list is paginated (Gitea caps a page at max_response_items,
# default 50), so tea_api_paged walks every page rather than silently truncating
# at ~50 open PRs (see _lib.sh).
#
# A truncated list of open PRs is not a shorter list of open PRs — it is a wrong
# one, and it looks identical. tea_api_paged reports that with exit status 3, so
# the walk is run on its own and its status inspected rather than piped straight
# into jq, where it would be discarded.
