 *   - `doctor.ts:verifyAgy()` — `codev doctor`'s OAuth probe, a second spawn

 *   - `doctor.ts:checkAgy()` — presence check; does not spawn, but resolution
 *     itself is not passive

 * spawn sites: the unpinned lookup runs `agyRespondsToVersion()`, which
 * *executes* the candidate binary with `--version`. Guarding only the spawns
 * would leave a suite executing the developer's real agy — no browser window
 * from a version print, but a violation of the invariant all the same.
 *
 * Guarding here is safe for the resolution tests because they all pin
