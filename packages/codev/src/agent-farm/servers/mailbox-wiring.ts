/**
 * Live-Tower wiring for mailbox delivery (Spec 1313, Phase 4).
 *
 * `mailbox-delivery.ts` holds the PURE orchestration (persist → gate → deliver |
 * hold) behind the {@link DeliveryPorts} seam. This module binds those ports to
 * the real Tower — the live terminal registry, the render-gate, paced PTY writes,
 * and the WebSocket message bus — and owns the backstop drainer's lifecycle,
 * which replaces the retired in-memory `SendBuffer`.
 *
 * Keeping the wiring here (not in the pure module) is what lets the orchestration
 * be unit-tested without a live Tower, and lets `handleSend` and the drainer share
 * exactly one delivery path (and one per-agent write serializer).
