/**
 * Mailbox delivery orchestration (Spec 1313, Phase 4).
 *
 * The single gate-checked delivery path: **persist → serialize → gate → deliver |
 * hold**. Both the send request (`handleSend`, after it enqueues) and the periodic
 * backstop drainer route every GATED delivery through {@link deliverAgentMail}, so for
 * gate-checked delivery a message body reaches a PTY in exactly one place — and only
 * onto a prompt the render-gate has proven empty. This is what eliminates corruption by
 * construction for that path: a message can never fuse with a draft, because it is never
 * delivered while one exists; and there is no force path.
 *
 * TWO deliberate exceptions write a body OUTSIDE this path, both explicit human
 * gate-bypasses documented at their `tower-routes.ts` call sites: immediate `--interrupt`
 * (Ctrl+C then the message) and `--escape` (a bare ESC). They are the operator's "I am at
 * this terminal now" actions and take the separate per-terminal submission lock
 * (`session-submit.ts`), not the per-agent serializer here — every autonomous/scheduled/
 * held send, by contrast, delivers through this gate.
 *
 * This module replaces the in-memory `SendBuffer` (retired in this phase): held
 * messages now live in the durable `mailbox` table, so nothing is lost to a Tower
 * crash/restart, and shutdown no longer force-flushes onto the line.
 *
 * Everything the delivery logic touches at the edges — resolving the live session
 * for an agent, resolving its classifier profile (incl. the wrapped-launch
 * fallback), running the gate, writing, broadcasting — is injected via
 * {@link DeliveryPorts}, so the orchestration is unit-testable without a live Tower.
