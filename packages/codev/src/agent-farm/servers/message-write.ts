 * final scheduled offset (`doneMs`); `writeMessageToSession` registers the Enter's
 * `setTimeout` at that same offset *before* this resolve is scheduled, so the Enter
 * executes first and its result is observed by resolution time.

 * completion-chaining real — the next delivery cannot begin until this submit
