/**
 * Due-time timer for the delayed `afx send --delay --interrupt` path (Spec 1307,
 * reshaped by Spec 1313 round 3).
 *
 * ## What this module does NOW (and no longer does)
 *
 * The message *body* of every `--delay` send is persisted to the durable mailbox
 * at REQUEST time, with a `not_before` due time, by `handleDelayedSend` in
 * tower-routes.ts — NOT here, and NOT at fire time. The gated backstop drainer
 * delivers that row once `not_before` passes, so a plain `--delay` keeps no timer
 * at all and survives a Tower restart by construction.
 *
 * This module holds a due-time timer used by ONE caller: the delayed-`--interrupt`
 * path. When it fires it writes only the prompt-ready keystrokes for that target — Ctrl+C
 * on claude/codex and shells, ESC then Ctrl+U on opencode (#196) — with no message body,
 * and it marks nothing `delivered`. The body then lands through the same render gate every
 * send uses, once the turn has ended.
 *
 * ## Why the registry exists at all
 *
 * A bare `setTimeout` would work until Tower shuts down, at which point the
 * process would either hang on a pending timer or exit with an interrupt half-scheduled
 * and no record of it. The registry makes shutdown explicit.
 *
 * ## Shutdown drops the interrupt nudge, never the message
 *
 * A pre-due `--delay` message is a persisted mailbox row: it survives a restart
 * and delivers when the target's prompt is next clean. Only the in-memory nudge — Ctrl+C,
 * or ESC then Ctrl+U on opencode (#196) — is dropped on shutdown; recoverable (a human
 * re-interrupts if it matters),
 * and matching the documented "only the interrupt semantics gracefully degrade"
 * boundary. This is the CONSCIOUS reversal of Spec 1307's original body-drop-on-
 * restart trade (see review 1313): the render gate now supplies the protection that
 * trade wanted — a post-restart delivery still only lands on a render-verified empty
 * prompt, and a stale pending row is visible and cancellable in `afx inbox`.

 * NOTE: this module no longer serialises deliveries. It used to hold a

 * lock. One mechanism, not two — per the architect's ruling that this project
 * adopts the primitive rather than keeping a rival.
 */

/**
 * Incremented by every shutdown. Each scheduled send captures the value current
 * when it was scheduled and re-checks it at delivery.
 *
 * Clearing the pending timers is not sufficient on its own. A message whose
 * timer has already fired is out of `pending` but its delivery may not have
 * started yet — it can be waiting on the session's `submitToSession` lock
 * behind an in-flight write. That queued delivery would otherwise run AFTER
 * shutdown, which is exactly what "shutdown drops pending delayed sends"
 * promises it will not. The generation check re-read at delivery time makes
 * such an already-scheduled delivery a no-op.
 *
 * Honest bound: a delivery that has ALREADY begun its write when shutdown fires
 * still completes — the lock does not interrupt a write in progress. "Drops on
 * shutdown" therefore means "does not START anything new," not "aborts what is
 * mid-flight." See the shutdown function.
