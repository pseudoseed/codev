/**
 * Spec 1470, Phase 7 — cross-tree parity and the delay-documentation correction.
 *
 * Spec test 39 (cross-tree parity) is covered JOINTLY by this file and
 * `commands/porch/__tests__/spec-1470-boundary-config.test.ts`. That file owns
 * schema-content parity — that all three `protocol-schema.json` copies describe
 * `context_refresh` identically. This file owns structural parity: protocol
 * directories, `$schema` resolution (including through a real scaffold), skill
 * copies, and the delay claim. Neither is complete alone.
 *
 * This phase exists because a false sentence in `--delay`'s help text propagated
 * into this project's own spec as a Constraint and survived until review. The
 * lesson is not "fix the sentence" — it is that a claim repeated across four
 * skill copies, a CLI flag and a type comment has no single place to be wrong,
 * so nothing catches it drifting from the code. These tests are that check.
 *
 * Scope note: the assertions below deliberately do NOT scan `codev/specs`,
 * `codev/plans`, `codev/reviews`, `codev/projects` or `codev/state`. Those are
 * the historical record, and several of them quote the stale wording precisely
 * because they are documenting that it WAS stale. Rewriting history to make a
 * grep pass would destroy the evidence trail this project's review depends on.
