/**
 * Issue #1279 — every protocol template must have an owning consumer.
 *
 * Spec 1011 introduced `{{> <codev-path>}}` includes (`resolveCodevIncludes`) as
 * the resolver-aware way to *deliver* a framework file to a builder. It was wired
 * for three of the nine shipped templates and never generalized, so six templates
 * rotted unreferenced: builders never saw them, reviewers never checked against
 * them, and two hand-rolled inline copies had already drifted from the templates
 * they duplicated.
 *
 * The invariant this file enforces: a file under `protocols/<p>/templates/` is
 * dead code unless some prompt or `protocol.md` delivers it via a `{{> }}`
 * include. Both directions are checked — no orphaned template, and no dangling
 * include — across BOTH trees (`codev-skeleton/` ships to adopters, `codev/` is
 * this repo's own instance; the mirror convention requires parity).
 *
 * The last describe block is a mutation check: it seeds an unreachable template
 * into a copy of the real tree and proves the detector FAILS on it. An
 * enforcement test that cannot fail is decoration.
