/**
 * The `consult` command's flag registration and its mapping onto `ConsultOptions`.
 *
 * Extracted from cli.ts (spec 1286) because those two things drifting apart is a real failure
 * class, not a hypothetical one: `--model-id` shipped registered, parsed, documented in `--help`,
 * covered by passing unit tests at the runner level — and completely inert, because the action
 * built its options object field-by-field and simply didn't copy it across. Nothing failed loudly;
 * the flag just did nothing.
 *
 * Keeping the registration and the mapping in one file lets a unit test compare them directly:
 * commander can report every option it registered, so the test asserts each one is forwarded.
 * That check runs in the normal test suite, so the next dropped field fails at the phase that
 * introduces it rather than in a reviewer's manual run.

Codev validates syntax only — whether the id exists is the provider\'s call, and a rejection fails loudly with no fallback.
